A school project that could be utilized at home.

People say that necessity is the mother of invention. Not ture, it is laziness and this project is a proof of that.

The idea is that you will not have to check the bathroom physically to know whether it is ocuppied or not. Simply use your raspberry to run a programme that will tell you the bathroom status. The main reason for doing this is that the house where I live is relatively large and it has 6 tennats with just 1 bathroom. This way I will not have to walk down all the way from my room to the bathroom only to find out that one of my roommates is taking a shower.
